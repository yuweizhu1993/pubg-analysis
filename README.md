# CMU 15688 Fall 2019 Final Project: PUBG data analysis

This repo is the final project for CMU 15688 Practical Data Science (Fall 2019) course. The requirement for 
this project is here: [project](http://www.datasciencecourse.org/assignments/project/).

We decide to use the dataset provided by PUGB, a famous Battle Royale-style video game for this project. The motivation behid analyzing PUBG dataset
is two-folded, figuring out what is the best gaming strategy for players and what are some data-driven improvements for gam developers.
To achieve these goals, we first conducted exploratory data analysis to identify some favorable behaviors and trained a LightGBM model
to predict the wining place. Then we used two unsupervised learning method to find interesting player clusters and potential cheaters.

We also created a short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0OR1FYodfE) to demonstrate this project.
